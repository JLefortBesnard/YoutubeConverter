Tip: if you copy-pasted a Youtube URL that contains many videos (Youtube playlist), for example this link including 23 videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pii92ft5qg&list=PLPWezF-reU2c_IJ46TS4JzJtA1tlUF-dy, then all the videos from the playlist will be downloaded but not mp3 converted and deleted.
To solve this issue, once all the videos are downloaded in the folder "music", follow these steps:
1. open a new terminal window, activate python
2. cd into the music folder, something like "cd Desktop/music"
3. make sure you are in the "music" folder where all videos are 
(type "pwd" and press Enter: the last part of the path must be "../music")
(type "ls" and press Enter: should display all the video in mp4 to be mp3 converted)
4. copy-paste the playlist_youtube.py script and press Enter, or simply type: run playlist_youtube.py
That's it, enjoy!
